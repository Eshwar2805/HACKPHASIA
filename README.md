# Optimizing Climate-Resilient Agricultural Practices Using AI ðŸŒ¾

## Overview
This project aims to leverage artificial intelligence to predict the most suitable crops for specific regions, addressing the challenges posed by climate change. By analyzing data such as temperature, rainfall, and soil type, the AI model provides recommendations that promote food security, sustainable farming, and climate resilience.

   - **Input**: Regional data including temperature, rainfall, and soil type.
   - **Output**: Recommendations for the best crop and farming advice for the given region.

2. **Alignment with SDGs**:
   - **SDG 2**: Zero Hunger.
   - **SDG 12**: Responsible Consumption and Production.
   - **SDG 13**: Climate Action.

3. **Simplified Problem Scope**:
   - Objective: Predict optimal crops for specific regions.
   - Approach: Data collection, model training, and actionable recommendations.

4. **Data Processing**:
   - Data cleaning with Pandas.
   - Feature encoding (e.g., One-Hot Encoding for soil type).
   - Normalization of numerical features using MinMaxScaler.

5. **Model Development**:
   - Models: Random Forest Classifier or Decision Tree Classifier.
   - Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
   - Evaluate performance using accuracy and F1-score.
